## Code Quality Issues

### Duplication Analysis

✅ **No Significant Duplication Found**

I checked for duplication and found:
- Reusable components properly abstracted (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- API services follow DRY principles
- No duplicate logic across pages
- Utility functions centralized in `lib/utils.ts`

**Status**: GOOD - No duplication issues

### Architecture Issues

✅ **Architecture is Sound**

- Good separation of concerns
- Services layer properly abstracted
- Type safety throughout
- Clean folder structure

**Status**: GOOD - No major architecture issues

### Missing Patterns

❌ **Real-time Updates Pattern Missing**
- No WebSocket connection
- No polling mechanism
- No event system for updates

❌ **File Upload Pattern Missing**
- No drag-and-drop implementation
- No file validation logic
- No progress tracking

❌ **Form Management Pattern Missing**
- Forms are placeholders
- No form state management beyond basic cases
- No multi-step form logic

---

## Integration Issues

### Backend Integration

✅ **Backend API Integration is Correct**

- All endpoints properly typed
- Request/response handling correct
- Error handling implemented
- Token management works

**Status**: GOOD - No integration issues with existing backend

### Data Flow Issues

⚠️ **Incomplete Data Flow**

1. **Property Creation Flow**: Broken
   - Frontend form missing → Cannot create
   
2. **Conversation Takeover Flow**: Broken
   - Frontend functionality missing → Cannot takeover

3. **Analytics Data Flow**: Missing
   - Frontend charts missing → Data not visualized

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact

| Feature Missing | Business Impact | Severity |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Property Forms | Agents cannot onboard properties | 🔴 CRITICAL |

### Honest Assessment

**The implementation is approximately 50% complete according to the plan.**

What was delivered:

What's missing:
- ❌ All create/edit/update functionality
